
This is the first evaluation of Module 1 in Data Analytics Bootcamp. 
The main goal is to create a class that serves as a framework to build our own virtual store.
My online shop is called "Grafos"

The TiendaOnline class allows you to manage a product inventory, update stock, calculate total values, and process purchases efficiently. This project is an introductory exercise in object-oriented programming and data manipulation with Python.
